	     * NOTICE: To make this example easier to set-up and run,
	     * the following call causes RMI to use a socket factory
	     * that is only capable of invoking remote methods over
	     * HTTP to a CGI script (or servlet).  This client
	     * simulates the behavior that an RMI client would have if
	     * it were forced to invoke remote calls on a server that
	     * resided outside a local firewall.
	     *
	     * It is not recommended that you make use of this sun
	     * implementation class (or any sun.* class) in general-
	     * purpose applications for the following reasons:
	     *
	     *   - Sun Microsystem's does not support the use of 
             *     sun.* classes.
	     *   - All sun.* classes are specific to Sun Microsystem's
	     *     implementation of the Java Development Kit.
	     *       
	     * To fully test the example, you will need to comment out
	     * the following line of code, ensure that the client and
	     * server are on opposite sides of a firewall and set the
	     * client VM's proxy host properties as follows:
	     *
	     *   java -Dhttp.proxyHost=<proxyHost> -Dhttp.proxyPort=<proxyPort> 
	     *       samplermi.SampleRMIClient <servletHostname>
