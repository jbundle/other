<H2>JTerminal - Technical Notes</H2>
<P>JTerminal is a Java2 Application. The key design goals for
JTerminal were:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Design Simplicity. Although JTerminal has gotten rather
	large, it is based on the industry-standard MVC
	(model-view-controller) architecture with simple base classes.</P>
	<LI><P>Deployment flexibility. JTerminal is based on a modular
	design which breaks it into small manageable pieces.</P>
</UL>
<P>At first, it may seen a bit overwelming browsing through the
classes, but none of this code is that difficult.</P>
<H3>Design:</H3>
<P>There are two main packages and six sub-packages:<BR><B>properties</B>
- These are the main classes for loading and changing configuration
parameters for the JTerminal components. The screen that is used to
change parameters is called a PropertyView, the component that the
parameters apply to is called a PropertyOwner. If anyone knows of a
public framework to do this, tell me.<BR><B>terminal </B>- This is
the main package for JTerminal. It contains the intefaces for Models,
Views, and Controllers. It also contains the main applet/application
class and global constants.<BR>Note: The terminal.control/model/view
classes are all derived from a RemoteXXX class. The allows them all
to be RMI Servers so they can deliver their payload to a remote
process (A remote applet/application connects to a remote control, a
servlet connects to the remote view)<BR><B>terminal.control.*</B> -
These are the control(ler) classes.<BR><B>terminal.model.*</B> -
These are the model classes. Duh: A 24 x 80 Matrix containing
characters and state.<BR><B>terminal.view.*</B> - These are the view
classes.<BR><B>terminal.rc</B> - These are some very simple classes
that are the start of a remote control package.<BR><B>terminal.server</B>
These classes comprise the remote (RMI) server.<BR><B>terminal.servlet</B>
- These are the servlet classes, which connect to the view of a remote
server then converts the view to html (pretty simple)</P>
<H3>Deploying (running) JTerminal:</H3>
<P>The easiest way to install JTerminal on your system is to use the
Java WebStart install on the main screen. This allows you to run
JTerminal as a local terminal emulator.<BR>If you want to run
JTerminal the old way, or you want to set it up to be accessed
remotely, here is how you install it:<BR>1. Download <a href="classes/terminal.jar">terminal.jar</a><BR>2.
run JTerminal by typing (you must have the javasoft comm packages
installed and the comm.jar in your classpath)<BR>    java -jar
terminal.jar<BR>3. If you want to run JTerminal as a RMI server (for
HTML for Remote access) you need to have an RMI registry running.
Sorry this part of the instructions aren't terriblly clear, but
running an RMI server is covered in detail at the javasoft site.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">a. You should set up JINI on your
machine. If not, just type rmiregistry in your Java2 bin
directory.<BR>
b. Start JTerminal so it can function as an RMI server
(you need a policy file and a web server for this):<BR>    java
-Djava.rmi.server.codebase=http://www.yourserver.com/terminal/classes/terminal.jar
-Djava.security.policy=./etc/policy -jar terminal.jar<BR>c. Then, go
to file -&gt; settings and change the Control, View, and Models to be
RMI Servers (by checking RMI Server).<BR>d. Now, you are ready to run
your client:<BR>For the Servlet client, the RMI server is
automatically assumed to be on codebase's server.<BR>For a JTerminal
client, just Change the control to an RMI control and enter the
server name in the property window.</P>
<OL START=4>
	<P>4. To supply a different property file name, pass
	properties=filename.properties to an application or applet.</P>
</OL>
<H3>To do (When I get some free time):</H3>
<OL>
	<LI><P>More emulations (VT-100, ANSI, etc).</P>
	<LI><P>Better documentation.</P>
	<P>Help, Help, Help! If you are a programmer help me make JTerminal
	better. Although this documentation is spotty, Jterminal's design is
	really very simple and can be easily enhanced. Email me if you want
	to help me improve this program.</P>
</OL>
<P>JTerminal is open source. You can look at the source, copy it,
sell it. You just can't remove the copyright notice or count on me to
support it.</P>
<P>Here is the zip of this distribution (including the source code):
<a href="../src/terminal.zip">terminal.zip</a> (you may have to right-click and select download file)
If you want to put jterminal on another web-server just unzip this
and place the files in your (tomcat compatible) directory.</P>
<P>All of the source code is also here on-line. To browse my source
directory, <A HREF="../src/">click here</A>.</P>
Oh yeah, There is no warranty with this software and don't try to run a nuclear
power plant with this software.
