        Take a good look at this web page. I know, I'm no Michelangelo.

        It looks kind of like a regular web page, right. Except there are those areas that keep changing.

      <p>
        Try it for yourself. Move some of the calendar items around. Bring up another web page, start 
        a stand-alone application or better
        yet have your friend in Outer Mongolia bring up the same page. Have her make a change. Hey, you can
        see her change.

        More interesting is what you didn't see. You are behind that restrictive corporate firewall. Your
        computer's security profile is so prohibitive that you can't read your personal e-mail. Have you
        seen that scary message asking you to grant access to your machine... not here!

        JBundle is an open-source framework for writing applications for the Internet.
